# Dist Rust

PDF, CDF, and percent-point/quantile functions for the normal and Studentâ€™s t distributions

ðŸŽ‰ Zero dependencies

[![Build Status](https://github.com/ankane/dist-rust/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ankane/dist-rust/actions)

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s `Cargo.toml` under `[dependencies]`:

```toml
distrs = "0.2"
```

## Getting Started

- [Normal](#normal)
- [Studentâ€™s t](#students-t)

### Normal

```rust
use distrs::Normal;

Normal::pdf(x, mean, std_dev);
Normal::cdf(x, mean, std_dev);
Normal::ppf(p, mean, std_dev);
```

### Studentâ€™s t

```rust
use distrs::StudentsT;

StudentsT::pdf(x, df);
StudentsT::cdf(x, df);
StudentsT::ppf(p, df);
```

## Features

- `no_std` - enable `no_std` support (requires [libm](https://github.com/rust-lang/libm))
